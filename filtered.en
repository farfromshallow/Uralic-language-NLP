The injection is given under the skin in the neck just behind the ear.
It is not intended to provide practical advice on how to use Improvac.
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Improvac on 11 May 2009.
The full EPAR for Improvac can be found on the Agency's website: ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Veterinary medicines/European public assessment reports.
The Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) concluded that Improvac's benefits are greater than its risks and recommended that it be approved for use in the EU.
The most common side effects with Improvac (which may affect more than 1 in 10 pigs) are injection site swelling, which gradually resolves but in 20 to 30% of animals will last for more than 6 weeks, and a short-lived increase in body temperature of around 0.5 ˚C within 24 hours of vaccination.
These may include a temporary reduction in sex hormone levels and reduced ability to reproduce in men and in women, including problems with pregnancy.
The risk of these effects occurring is greater after a second or subsequent accidental injection than after a first injection.
In case of skin or eye contact the affected area should be rinsed immediately with water.
Boar taint is caused by the production and build-up of the natural compounds androstenone and skatole in the flesh of these animals.
Three field studies investigated the effectiveness of Improvac in reducing aggression and sexual behaviour in pigs.
It explains how the Agency assessed this veterinary medicine to recommend its authorisation in the European Union (EU) and its conditions of use.
The withdrawal period for meat from pigs treated with Improvac is ‘zero' days, which means there is no mandatory waiting time.
Improvac starts to be effective within 1 week after the second injection.
What benefits of Improvac have been shown in studies?
The withdrawal period is the time required after administration of a medicine before an animal can be slaughtered and the meat used for human consumption.
This is a summary of the European public assessment report (EPAR) for Improvac.
The first injection is from 8 weeks of age and the second 4 to 6 weeks before slaughter.
The first injection had a limited effect, but the second injection is followed by production of antibodies against GnRF.
Skatole, the other major cause of boar taint, is produced in the intestines and levels are reduced since the reduced level of sex hormones allows the liver to metabolise (break it down) more efficiently.
Boar taint is the offensive odour or taste which may be present in pork or pork products from non-castrated mature male pigs.
Improvac also reduces aggressive and sexual (mounting) behaviour in pigs.
Safety information has been included in the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet for Improvac, including the appropriate precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and animal owners or keepers.
Improvac is available as a solution for injection and can only be obtained with a prescription.
Improvac is a veterinary medicine used in male pigs to reduce ‘boar taint' in the meat obtained from them after slaughter.
What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal?
This temporarily inhibits release of steroids from the testicles, including androstenone, one of the two causes of boar taint.
Improvac must only be used with a safety device including a needle guard and a mechanism to prevent accidental operation of the trigger.
Improvac works by stimulating the pig's immune system to produce antibodies against gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), part of the system that controls sexual development.
Accidental self-injection of Improvac may produce similar effects in people to those seen in pigs.
In addition Improvac treated pigs had reduced blood levels of testosterone.
The levels of antibodies decline with time but are still high enough to be reliably effective 4 to 6 weeks after the second injection.
Special care should be taken to avoid accidental self-injection.
Improvac also contains a compound derived from the sugar dextran as an adjuvant (ingredient that strengthens the immune response).
Improvac is used as an alternative to physical castration (removal of the testes) to reduce the presence of these compounds.
Improvac is given to male pigs as two injections with at least a 4 week interval.
In case of accidental self-injection, medical advice should be sought immediately and the package leaflet or label shown to the doctor.
The active substance in Improvac is an analogue of (similar to) gonatadotropin releasing factor (GnRF) linked to a carrier protein obtained from the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae.
In a number of field studies pigs treated with Improvac were comparable to surgically castrated pigs in terms of levels of androstenone and skatole at slaughter.
Improvac gonadotropin releasing factor (GnRF) analogue-protein conjugate
For the full list of restrictions and all side effects reported with Improvac, see the package leaflet.
Improvac must not be given to female pigs or to male pigs intended for breeding.
Improvac must not be given to pigs by women who are or who may be pregnant.
Androstenone and skatole levels are reduced from 4 to 6 weeks after the second injection and reduction of aggression and sexual behaviour is seen from 1 to 2 weeks after the second injection.
For practical information about using Improvac, animal owners or keepers should read the package leaflet or contact their veterinarian or pharmacist.
Two studies showed reduction of aggression and mounting from 1 to 2 weeks after the second injection of Improvac, while the third studied the long term effect on aggression and mounting after 4 weeks only.
For more information about treatment with Improvac, animal owners or keepers should read the package leaflet or contact their veterinarian or pharmacist.
Improvac contains the active substance gonadotropin releasing factor (GnRF) analogue-protein conjugate.
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Preotact on 24 April 2006.
The full EPAR for Preotact can be found on the Agency's website: ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Human medicines/European Public Assessment Reports.
About two-thirds of the women continued taking Preotact for up to two years, and their bone density was measured.
This is a summary of the European public assessment report (EPAR) for Preotact.
The main measure of effectiveness was the rate of vertebral fractures after 18 months of treatment.
It also increases the absorption of calcium from food and prevents too much calcium from being lost in the urine.
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the medicine to reach its opinion in favour of granting a marketing authorisation and its recommendations on the conditions of use for Preotact.
The risk reduction was higher in women who already had a fractured vertebra in the past, and in women whose score for spine bone density was already low at the start of the study, indicating that they had a more fragile spine.
Gradually, the bones become thin and fragile, and more likely to break (fracture).
The CHMP decided that Preotact's benefits are greater than its risks and recommended that it be given marketing authorisation.
What benefit has Preotact shown during the studies?
• who have any disorder that affects the calcium and phosphate balance in the body,
Preotact has been studied in one main study involving 2,532 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.
It is produced by a method known as ‘recombinant DNA technology': the hormone is made by a bacterium that has received a gene (DNA) that makes it able to produce it.
Increases in bone density were also seen during the study.
The bone density was also the main measure in another study, which looked at the use of Preotact with or without alendronate (a bisphosphonate).
The most common side effects with Preotact (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are hypercalcaemia (high blood calcium levels), hypercalciuria (high calcium levels in the urine) and nausea (feeling sick).
Preotact significantly reduced the risk of having a vertebral fracture, in comparison with placebo: after 18 months, there were 42 vertebral fractures in the placebo group (3.37) and 17 in the Preotact group (1.32).
• who have bone cancer or cancer that has spread to the bones,
• who are having or have had radiation therapy to the skeleton,
Patients may inject themselves once they have been trained (a user manual is supplied).
The study of Preotact with alendronate showed that using alendronate after Preotact can bring further increases in bone density.
When the cartridge is inserted in the special injection pen and the pen screwed together, or when the pre-filled pen is prepared for use, the powder and solvent mix to make up the solution for injection.
• with unexplained high levels of alkaline phosphatase (an enzyme),
The recommended dose of Preotact is 100 micrograms, given once a day as an injection under the skin into the abdomen.
Preotact must not be used in people who are hypersensitive (allergic) to parathyroid hormone or any of the other ingredients.
Preotact has been shown to significantly reduce vertebral (spine) fractures, but not hip fractures.
Osteoporosis happens when not enough new bone grows to replace the bone that is naturally broken down.
Osteoporosis is more common in women after the menopause, when the levels of the female hormone oestrogen fall.
For more information about treatment with Preotact, read the package leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
Preotact is used for the treatment of osteoporosis (a disease that makes bones fragile) in postmenopausal women who are at high risk of fractures.
Preotact contains parathyroid hormone, which stimulates bone formation by acting on osteoblasts (bone forming cells).
For the full list of all side effects with Preotact, see the package leaflet.
The parathyroid hormone in Preotact is identical to the human parathyroid hormone.
Preotact is a medicine that contains the active substance parathyroid hormone.
Patients may also need to take calcium and vitamin D supplements if they do not have enough from their diet. Preotact can be used for up to 24 months, after which patients can be treated with a bisphosphonate (a medicine that reduces bone loss).
• with severely reduced kidney or liver function.
It is available as a powder and solvent, contained within a cartridge, to be made up into a solution for injection using a special injection pen.
It is also available as a pre-filled pen incorporating the cartridge containing the powder and solvent Each cartridge contains 14 doses.
As a result, it stops the growth of tumour cells and eventually kills them.
For other types of cancer, treatment is stopped if the disease gets worse or the patient cannot tolerate the treatment.
Treatment is continued for six months after colon surgery.
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Capecitabine Medac on 19 November 2012.
This means that it is similar to a ‘reference medicine', but it contains capecitabine at a new strength in addition to existing strengths.
The full EPAR for Capecitabine Medac can be found on the Agency's website: ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Human medicines/European public assessment reports.
It is taken as tablets, while 5-FU normally needs to be injected.
Pyrimidine is part of the genetic material of cells (DNA and RNA).
Capecitabine Medac is taken twice a day at doses between 625 and 1,250 mg per square metre body surface area (calculated using the patient's height and weight).
Therefore, the CHMP's view was that, as for Xeloda, the benefit outweighs the identified risk.
In the body, 5-FU takes the place of pyrimidine and interferes with the enzymes involved in making new DNA.
The doctor will calculate the number of 150, 300 and 500 mg tablets the patient needs to take.
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the medicine to reach its opinion in favour of granting a marketing authorisation and its recommendations on the conditions of use for Capecitabine Medac.
The company carried out a ‘bioequivalence' study to show that 500 mg Capecitabine Medac produces the same levels of capecitabine in the blood as 500 mg Xeloda.
Capecitabine Medac tablets should be swallowed with water within 30 minutes after a meal.
This is a summary of the European public assessment report (EPAR) for Capecitabine Medac.
It can also be used on its own when treatment with both anthracyclines and taxanes (another type of anticancer medicine) has failed or when repeat treatment with anthracyclines is not suitable for the patient.
For more information on generic and hybrid medicines, see the questionand-answer document here.
The company provided data from the published literature on capecitabine.
Capecitabine is a ‘prodrug' that is converted to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in the body, but more is converted in tumour cells than in normal tissues.
While the reference medicine, Xeloda, is available as 150 and 500 mg tablets, Capecitabine Accord is also available as 300 mg tablets.
Doses need to be adjusted for patients with liver or kidney disease and for patients who develop certain side effects.
The CHMP concluded that, in accordance with EU requirements, Capecitabine Medac has been shown to have comparable quality and to be bioequivalent to Xeloda.
What are the benefits and risks of Capecitabine Medac?
Because Capecitabine Medac contains the same active substance as its reference medicine, its benefits and risks are taken as being the same as the reference medicine's.
The full EPAR for the reference medicine can also be found on the Agency's website.
For more information about treatment with Capecitabine Medac, read the package leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
The Committee recommended that Capecitabine Medac be given marketing authorisation.
Full details are available in the summary of product characteristics (also part of the EPAR).
Capecitabine Medac is a ‘generic' and a ‘hybrid' medicine.
Capecitabine Medac should only be prescribed by a doctor who is qualified in the use of anticancer medicines.
The active substance in Capecitabine Medac, capecitabine, is a cytotoxic medicine (a medicine that kills cells that are dividing, such as cancer cells) that belongs to the group ‘anti-metabolites'.
Capecitabine Medac is used with or without other anticancer medicines in patients who have had surgery for ‘stage III' or ‘Dukes' stage C' colon cancer;
Capecitabine Medac is used with other anticancer medicines, including a platinum-containing anticancer medicine such as cisplatin;
Capecitabine Medac is a medicine that contains the active substance capecitabine.
Capecitabine Medac is used with docetaxel (another anticancer medicine) after treatment with anthracyclines (another type of anticancer medicine) has failed.
• metastatic colorectal cancer (cancer of the large bowel that has spread to other parts of the body).
It may harm them, even if their symptoms are the same as yours.
The expiry date refers to the last day of that month.
Some patients experience stomach upset after the morning dose.
Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine.
Wilson's disease will persist during the entire lifetime of the patient and therefore the need for this treatment is life-long.
Date of first authorisation: 13 October 2004 Date of latest renewal: 13 October 2009
SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR DISPOSAL OF UNUSED MEDICINAL PRODUCTS OR WASTE MATERIALS DERIVED FROM SUCH MEDICINAL PRODUCTS, IF APPROPRIATE

Please tell your doctor or your pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet.
Data are very limited in children under 6 years but since the disease is fully penetrant, prophylactic treatment should be considered as early as possible.
Uncommon: • A decrease in blood red and white cells may occur.
D. CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Five miscarriages and 2 birth defects (microcephaly and correctable heart defect) were reported in 42 pregnancies.
Always take Wilzin exactly as your doctor has told you.
Anaemia may be micro-, normo- or macrocytic and is often associated with leukopenia.
The holder of this marketing authorisation must inform the European Commission about the marketing plans for the medicinal product authorised by this decision.
It is extremely important that pregnant Wilson's disease patients continue their therapy during pregnancy.
If you forget to take Wilzin: Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten individual dose.
Monitoring may detect evidence of insufficient treatment (copper excess) or excessive treatment (copper deficiency), both of which can be harmful, particularly to growing children and pregnant women.
If you become pregnant during therapy with Wilzin, your doctor will decide which treatment and which dose is best in your situation.
These side effects may occur with certain frequencies, which are defined as follows: • very common:
There is no difference in dose between symptomatic and presymptomatic patients.
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines webportal.
If you take more Wilzin than prescribed, you may experience nausea, vomiting and dizziness.
You should tell your doctor if you experience unusual muscle weakness or abnormal feeling in your limbs as this may indicate excessive treatment.
2D barcode carrying the unique identifier included.
A change of therapy is recommended in this situation.
• After Wilzin intake, gastric irritation may occur, especially at the beginning of treatment.
Pharmacological and toxicological data available showed large similarities between zinc salts and among animal species.
Heavy metal chelation therapy should be considered if plasma zinc levels are markedly elevated (> 10 mg/l).
There are also links to other websites about rare diseases and treatments.
Whether this is related to mobilisation of copper stores or to natural history of the disease remains unclear.
A dose of 25 mg 3 times daily is usually effective but the dose should be adjusted to copper levels (see section 4.4 and section 4.6).
This potentially leads to liver damage and neurological disorders.
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (See Annex I: Summary of Product Characteristics, section 4.2)
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Dietary fibres and some dairy products, in particular, delay the absorption of zinc salts.
In the blood, about 80% of absorbed zinc is distributed to erythrocytes, with most of the remainder being bound to albumin and other plasma proteins.
Please consult your doctor before taking any other medicines which may reduce the effectiveness of Wilzin, such as iron, calcium supplements, tetracyclines (antibiotics) or phosphorus.
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.
Please consult your doctor if you plan to become pregnant.
This side effect may be reduced by postponing the first dose of the day until mid-morning (between breakfast and the midday meal).
Do not take Wilzin If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to zinc or any of the other ingredients of Wilzin.
What Wilzin is and what it is used for Before you take Wilzin How to take Wilzin Possible side effects 5 How to store Wilzin Further information
It is very important to continue anti-copper therapy during pregnancy.
Studies of the co-administration of zinc with food performed in healthy volunteers showed that the absorption of zinc was significantly delayed by many foods (including bread, hard boiled eggs, coffee and milk).
- This medicine has been prescribed for you personally.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
If you are currently treated with another anti-copper agent, for example, penicillamine, your doctor may add Wilzin before stopping the initial treatment.
If you have been prescribed Wilzin with another anti-copper agent, such as penicillamine, keep an interval of at least 1 hour between the two medicines.
However, they must be distinguished from haemolytic anaemia which commonly occurs where there is elevated serum free copper in uncontrolled Wilson's disease.
As copper deficiency may also cause myeloneuropathy, physicians should be alert to sensory and motor symptoms and signs which may potentially indicate incipient neuropathy or myelopathy in patients treated with Wilzin.
In these patient groups, urinary copper levels should be kept a little above the upper limit of normal or in the high normal range (i.e. 40 - 50 microgram/24 h).
Like with all anti-copper agents overtreatment carries the risk of copper deficiency, which is especially harmful for children and pregnant women since copper is required for proper growth and mental development.
The printed package leaflet of the medicinal product must state the name and address of the manufacturer responsible for the release of the concerned batch.
Therefore, breast-feeding should be avoided during Wilzin therapy.
The plasma elimination half-life of zinc in healthy subjects is around 1 hour after a dose of 45 mg.
Pharmacotherapeutic group: various alimentary tract and metabolism products, ATC code: A16AX05.
Elevations of serum alkaline phosphatase, amylase and lipase may occur after a few weeks of treatment, with levels usually returning to high normal within the first one or two years of treatment.
This is probably due to some extent of complexion of zinc by the chelator, thus reducing the effect of both active substances.
Dietary copper, which cannot be properly eliminated, accumulates first in the liver, then in other organs such as the eyes and the brain.
Two patients of a series of 16 died from hepatic decompensation and advanced portal hypertension after being changed from penicillamine to zinc therapy.
The other ingredients are maize starch and magnesium stearate.
The level of hepatic copper cannot be used to manage therapy since it does not differentiate between potentially toxic free copper and metallothionein bound copper.
Urinary copper levels are usually increased with chelation therapy such as penicillamine or trientine.
• Changes in blood tests have been reported, including an increase in some liver and pancreatic enzymes.
It may also be minimised by taking the first dose of Wilzin with a small amount of protein-containing food, such as meat (but not milk).
It is also possible to take Wilzin with a little protein, such as meat (see section 4.5).
It is available in packs of 250 hard capsules in a polyethylene bottle closed by a polypropylene and polyethylene closure.
When the liver capacity of storing copper is exceeded copper is released into the blood and is taken up in extra hepatic sites, such as the brain, resulting in motor disorders and psychiatric manifestations.
The non-ceruloplasmin plasma copper is calculated by subtracting the ceruloplasmin-bound copper from the total plasma copper, given that each milligram of ceruloplasmin contains 3 micrograms of copper.
Detailed information on this product is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) http://www.ema.europa.eu
Always take Wilzin on an empty stomach, at least one hour before or 2-3 hours after meals.
In case of gastric intolerance, often occurring with the morning dose, this dose may be delayed to mid-morning, between breakfast and lunch.
Driving and using machines No studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Patients may present clinically with predominantly hepatic, neurologic, or psychiatric symptoms.
Since the mechanism of action of zinc is an effect on copper uptake at the level of the intestinal cell, pharmacokinetic evaluations based on blood levels of zinc do not provide useful information on zinc bioavailability at the site of action.
In children who are unable to swallow capsules, these should be opened and their content suspended in a little water (possibly sugar or syrup flavoured water).
Substances in food, especially phytates and fibres, bind zinc and prevent it from entering the intestinal cells.
The same dose did not produce any symptoms except for vomiting in an adolescent who was treated by whole-bowel irrigation.
frequency cannot be estimated from the available data.
No conventional carcinogenicity study has been conducted with zinc acetate dihydrate.
The absorption of zinc may be reduced by iron and calcium supplements, tetracyclines and phosphorus-containing compounds, while zinc may reduce the absorption of iron, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones.
Animal studies conducted with different zinc salts do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3).
Medicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste.
White HDPE bottle with a polypropylene and HDPE closure and contains a filler (cotton coil).
Wilzin must be taken on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2-3 hours after meals.
Caution should be exercised when switching patients with portal hypertension from a chelating agent to Wilzin, when such patients are doing well and the treatment is tolerated.
It is also possible to take Wilzin with a little protein, such as meat.
Another adolescent who ingested 4 g of zinc had serum zinc level of about 50 mg/l 5 hours later and only experienced severe nausea, vomiting and dizziness.

To administer Wilzin to children who are unable to swallow capsules, open the capsule and mix the powder with a little water (possibly flavoured with sugar or syrup).
Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency (EMA) web site: http://www.ema.europa.eu.
B. CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS REGARDING SUPPLY AND USE
The aim of the treatment is to maintain the plasma free copper (also known as non-ceruloplasmin plasma copper) below 250 microgram/l (normal: 100-150 microgram/l) and the urinary copper excretion below 125 microgram/24 h (normal: < 50 microgram/24 h).
The urinary excretion of copper is an accurate reflection of body loading with excess copper only when patients are not on chelation therapy.
Treatment of overdose should be with gastric lavage or induced emesis as quickly as possible to remove unabsorbed zinc.
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
The oral LD50 is approximately 300 mg zinc/kg body weight (about 100 to 150 times the human therapeutic dose).
Bone marrow examination usually reveals characteristic "ringed sideroblasts" (i.e. developing red blood cells containing iron-engorged paranuclear mitochondria).
They may be early manifestations of copper deficiency and may recover rapidly following reduction of zinc dosage.
DATE OF FIRST AUTHORISATION/RENEWAL OF THE AUTHORISATION
Wilzin is usually not recommended for initial therapy of patients with signs and symptoms of Wilson's disease because of its slow onset of action.
The printing ink contains black iron oxide (E172) and shellac.
The usual dose is 50 mg 3 times daily with a maximum dose of 50 mg 5 times daily.
Reproduction toxicology studies performed with different zinc salts showed no clinically relevant evidence of embryotoxicity, foetotoxicity or teratogenicity.
Zinc acetate dihydrate is not recommended for the initial therapy of symptomatic patients because of its slow onset of action.
Wilzin treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of Wilson's disease (see section 4.4).
Data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies in patients with Wilson's disease give no indication of harmful effects of zinc on embryo/foetus and mother.
A daily regimen of 150 mg of Wilzin in three administrations was shown to be effective in significantly reducing copper absorption and inducing a negative copper balance.
blood amylase, lipase and alkaline phosphatase increased
Three cases of acute oral overdose with zinc salts (sulphate or gluconate) have been reported in the literature.
Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is an autosomal recessive metabolic defect in hepatic excretion of copper in the bile.
Preclinical studies have been conducted with zinc acetate and with other zinc salts.
Pharmacodynamic studies were conducted in Wilson's disease patients on the combination of Wilzin (50 mg three times daily) with ascorbic acid (1 g once daily), penicillamine (250 mg four times daily), and trientine (250 mg four times daily).
Nevertheless, while awaiting zinc induced duodenal metallothionein production and consequential effective inhibition of copper absorption, zinc acetate dehydrate could be administered initially in symptomatic patients in combination with a chelating agent.
Wilzin should be taken on an empty stomach, separated from mealtimes.
Pharmacodynamic investigations of copper metabolism in patients with Wilson's disease included determinations of net copper balance and radiolabelled copper uptake.
The capsule shell contains gelatin, titanium dioxide (E171) and either brilliant blue FCF (E133) for Wilzin 25 mg, or sunset yellow FCF (E110) for Wilzin 50 mg.
Values of urinary zinc above 2 mg/24 h and of plasma zinc above 1250 microgram/l generally indicate adequate compliance.
Repeat-dose toxicity studies have established that the NOEL (No Observed Effect Level) is about 95 mg zinc/kg body weight (about 48 times the human therapeutic dose).
The capsule shell contains sunset yellow FCF (E110), which may cause allergic reactions.
It ranges from 30 to 60% with usual dietary intake (7-15 mg/d) and decreases to 7% with pharmacological doses of 100 mg/d.
In order to follow up your condition and treatment your doctor will check your blood and urine on a regular basis.
When switching a patient on chelating treatment to Wilzin for maintenance therapy, the chelating treatment should be maintained and co-administered for 2 to 3 weeks since this is the time it takes for the zinc treatment to induce maximum metallothionein induction and full blockade of copper absorption.
6.1 List of excipients Capsule content maize starch magnesium stearate
Ask your pharmacist how to dispose of medicines no longer required.
The weight of evidence, from in vitro and in vivo tests, suggests that zinc has no clinically relevant genotoxic activity.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS Like all medicines, Wilzin can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them..
4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use
The faecal excretion is in the greatest part due to the passage of unabsorbed zinc but it is also due to endogenous intestinal secretion.
Laboratory follow-up including haematological surveillance and lipoproteins determination should also be performed in order to detect early manifestations of copper deficiency, such as anaemia and/or leukopenia resulting from bone marrow depression, and decrease in HDL cholesterol and HDL/total cholesterol ratio.
They showed no significant overall effect on copper balance although mild interaction of zinc with chelators (penicillamine and trientine) could be detected with decreased faecal but increased urinary copper excretion as compared with zinc alone.
PARTICULARS TO APPEAR ON THE OUTER PACKAGING AND ON THE IMMEDIATE PACKAGING
Which treatment should be used, zinc or chelating agent should be decided by the physician.
Conversely, the effectiveness of some medicines, such as iron, tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones (antibiotics), may be reduced by Wilzin.
SPECIAL WARNING THAT THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT MUST BE STORED OUT OF THE REACH AND SIGHT OF CHILDREN
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Wilzin blocks the absorption of copper from the intestine thereby preventing its transfer into the blood and its further accumulation in the body.
Dose adjustments to guarantee that the foetus will not become copper deficient must be done and close monitoring of the patient is mandatory (see section 4.4).
Fractional zinc absorption is negatively correlated with zinc intake.
• Do not use Wilzin after the expiry date stated on the bottle and the carton, after EXP.
The active moiety in zinc acetate dihydrate is zinc cation, which blocks the intestinal absorption of copper from the diet and the reabsorption of endogenously secreted copper.
Name and address of the manufacturer responsible for batch release
The administration of the chelating treatment and Wilzin should be separated by at least 1 hour.

Capsule shell gelatin titanium dioxide (E171) sunset yellow FCF (E110)
Wilzin belongs to a group of medicines called Various Alimentary Tract and metabolism products.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Wilzin Wilzin 50 mg hard capsules contains sunset yellow FCF (E110) which may cause allergic reactions.
Symptomatic patients must be initially treated with a chelating agent; once copper levels are below toxic thresholds and patients are clinically stable, maintenance treatment with Wilzin can be considered.
Wilzin is available in hard capsules of 25 mg or 50 mg.
The bound copper is then eliminated in the stool following desquamation of the intestinal cells.
Please discuss the matter with your Wilson's disease doctor if this affects you.
Reported adverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and by frequency.
The liver is the main storage for zinc and hepatic zinc levels are increased during maintenance therapy with zinc.
Although rare, clinical deterioration may occur at the beginning of the treatment, as has also been reported with chelating agents.
The elimination of zinc results primarily from faecal excretion with relatively little from urine and sweat.
In treated patients, assays of urinary and/or plasma zinc may be a useful measure of treatment compliance.
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
Zinc is absorbed in the small intestine and its absorption kinetics suggest a tendency to saturation at increasing doses.
Capsule with orange opaque cap and body, imprinted "93-377”.
Copper accumulation in the liver leads to hepatocellular injury and eventual cirrhosis.
Zinc induces the production of metallothionein in the enterocyte, a protein that binds copper thereby preventing its transfer into the blood.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

It is noted that in some cases increase of blood pressure was documented.
In addition, the EC requested the Agency to give its opinion, as soon as possible, as to whether provisional measures were necessary to ensure the safe and effective use of this medicinal product.
The EC requested the Agency to give its opinion on whether the marketing authorisation for this product should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked.
• In addition, several fatal cases were identified both in the literature and in the Eudravigilance database.
Information from some fatal cases indicates that current recommendations for monitoring may be insufficient.
Autoimmune disorders are an important identified risk for alemtuzumab.
According to existing recommendations, observation for infusion associated reactions (IARs) should be undertaken during and for two hours after infusion.
Despite these recommendations, in the majority of cases it was not possible to predict these cardiovascular reactions prior to hospital discharge, and reactions occurred outside a hospital setting.
The current recommendation relates only to provisional measures recommended by the PRAC for Lemtrada based on the preliminary data available at this time.
In view of the above, the European Commission (EC) initiated on 11 April 2019 a procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and requested the Agency to assess the above safety concerns and their impact on the benefit-risk balance for the centrally authorised medicinal product Lemtrada.
Several of the serious risks in relation to alemtuzumab resulted in fatal outcomes despite monitoring of the patients and adherence to the current risk minimisation measures such as pre-medication.
The cases of HLH and AIH suggest that despite the recommendations for intensive monitoring and alertness to immune mediated reactions until 48 months following last treatment course, it has not been possible to take adequate measures to detect them early enough.
During the assessment procedure of the periodic safety update report (PSUSA) for Lemtrada covering the period between 13 September 2017 and 12 September 2018, limited information was available on new emerging and serious safety concerns, including lack of detailed information on the individual cases, precluding a thorough evaluation.
- Fatal cases: Several fatal cases were identified during the PSUSA procedure, which indicate that the current recommendations for monitoring may be insufficient.
During the assessment of the periodic safety update report (PSUSA) for Lemtrada (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010055/201809), the following new emerging and serious safety concerns were highlighted in addition to the known safety profile of alemtuzumab, which raised major concerns to the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC):
Common to these cardiovascular reactions was a close temporal relationship to an alemtuzumab infusion, as the majority of cases occurred during the treatment course or within 1-3 days after the last infusion.
Thus, it is questioned whether the current risk minimisation measures are effective.
The Committee, as a consequence, recommends the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for Lemtrada (alemtuzumab).
Many of these cases were life-threatening or fatal.
In view of the seriousness of the events observed and until a thorough review of the data is finalised, it is appropriate to limit exposure of new patients to alemtuzumab by introducing amendments to the product information.
Cases of Haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (HLH) were identified.
These cases are characterised by specific MRI lesions and unexpected high total B cell count which may suggest a B-cell-mediated activation of disease.
Limited information, including lack of detailed information on the individual cases, precluded a thorough evaluation of their impact on the benefit risk of Lemtrada in view of the time constraints for the PSUSA assessment.
In addition, several cases of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) including fatalities were reported.
New life-threatening and potentially fatal immune- mediated reactions were identified.
It is therefore questioned whether the current risk minimisation measures are able to mitigate the risk of occurrence of these cardiovascular reactions.
This recommendation is without prejudice to the final conclusions of the ongoing procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.
Although efficacy of alemtuzumab in RRMS patients is well established, these emerging and serious safety concerns may impact the benefit-risk balance of Lemtrada.
• The PRAC noted that although efficacy of alemtuzumab in relapsed remitting multiple sclerosis patients is well established, these emerging and serious safety concerns can impact the benefit-risk balance of Lemtrada, and that until a thorough review is finalised, it would be appropriate as a provisional measure to limit the patients exposed to alemtuzumab.
There is little or no CD52 detected on neutrophils, plasma cells, or bone marrow stem cells.
HLH is a life-threatening condition of severe hyperinflammation caused by uncontrolled proliferation of activated lymphocytes and macrophages.
On this basis, the authors of the papers hypothesise that an autoimmune reaction could be directed at CNS in rare cases.
In view of the above, the Committee considers that the benefit-risk balance of Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) remains favourable subject to the agreed provisional amendments to the product information.
These provisional measures are without prejudice to the outcome of the ongoing review under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.
The temporal onset corresponded to the time of reconstitution of the immune system after depletion of B- and T-lymphocytes following Lemtrada treatment.
Severe B-cell-mediated CNS disease secondary to alemtuzumab therapy.
as to whether the risk minimisation measures currently in place are sufficient to adequately manage the risks associated to alemtuzumab in the current target population.
Therefore PRAC recommended that new treatment with Lemtrada should only be initiated in adult patients with highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least two other disease modifying treatments, or in adult patients with highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis where all other disease modifying treatments are contraindicated or otherwise unsuitable.
Therefore, in view of the seriousness of the events observed, the PRAC recommended provisional amendments to the product information to restrict use of alemtuzumab in new patients to adults with highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least two other disease modifying treatments, or to adults with highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis where all other disease modifying treatments are contraindicated or otherwise unsuitable.
• The PRAC considered the procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 resulting from pharmacovigilance data for Lemtrada, in particular the need for provisional measures in accordance with Article 20(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, taking into account the grounds set out in Articles 116 of Directive 2001/83/EC.
• In addition the PRAC considered important that the risk minimisation measures recommended within the assessment of the current PSUSA procedure are also implemented together with the provisional measures.
In addition the PRAC considered important that the risk minimisation measures recommended within the assessment of the current PSUSA procedure are also implemented together with the provisional measures.
This temporal relationship to alemtuzumab infusions is suggestive of a causal association.
New life-threatening and potentially fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions were identified, including haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis and autoimmune hepatitis.
The PRAC also noted that recent literature reports have highlighted B-cell mediated central nervous system (CNS) lesions with temporal onset of 6 months after infusion of alemtuzumab.
Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) is indicated for adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features.
• The PRAC reviewed the available data on cardiovascular reactions, including data provided by the marketing authorisation holder in the context of the PSUSA procedure.
The mechanism by which alemtuzumab exerts its therapeutic effects in MS is unknown but may involve immunomodulation through the depletion and repopulation of lymphocytes.
Literature reports1, 2, 3 have highlighted B-cell mediated central nervous system (CNS) lesions with temporal onset of 6 months after infusion of alemtuzumab.
New warnings on autoimmune hepatitis, hepatic injury and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis are also added.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that is characterized by inflammation, demyelination and neuronal loss.
- Immune-mediated diseases such as auto-immune hepatitis, hepatic injury, auto-immune-mediated central nervous system disease and Guillain-Barre syndrome.
Common to these cardiovascular reactions was a close temporal relationship to an alemtuzumab infusion, which is suggestive of a causal association.
Both T and B lymphocytes are involved in the pathogenesis of MS. Alemtuzumab binds to CD52, a cell surface antigen present at high levels on T and B lymphocytes, and at lower levels on natural killer cells, monocytes and macrophages.
- Cardiovascular adverse events in close temporal association with Lemtrada infusions (e.g. cardiac ischaemia and myocardial infarction, ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, arterial dissection, pulmonary haemorrhage and embolism, vasculitis and thrombocytopenia), including a possible mechanistic relation to these adverse events.
Several cases with various cardiovascular reactions with close temporal relationship with alemtuzumab administration were identified.
Alemtuzumab acts through antibody-dependent cellular cytolysis and complement-mediated lysis following cell surface binding to T and B lymphocytes.
• The PRAC also reviewed the available data on immune-mediated adverse events, including data provided by the marketing authorisation holder in the context of the PSUSA procedure.
The PRAC recommended as part of the PSUSA procedure the addition of warnings related to serious reactions temporally associated with alemtuzumab infusion including pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage, myocardial infarction, stroke (including ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke), cervicocephalic (e.g. vertebral, carotid) arterial dissection.
Furthermore, the following new adverse reactions are added: pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage, haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, myocardial infarction, stroke (including ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke), cervicocephalic arterial dissection and neutropenia.
Several cases with various cardiovascular reactions were identified, including pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage, myocardial infarction, and ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke as well as arterial dissection.

National Competent Authorities, coordinated by the Reference Member State as applicable, shall ensure the following:
The recommended dose is one inhalation twice a day.
Two medicines are bioequivalent when they produce the same levels of the active substance in the body.
Patients should be regularly assessed by a doctor to ensure that they receive the lowest dose sufficient to control symptoms.
It explains how the Agency assessed the medicine to recommend its authorisation in the EU and its conditions of use.
The full EPAR for Airexar Spiromax can be found on the Agency's website: ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Human medicines/European public assessment reports.
It works in a similar way to naturally occurring corticosteroid hormones, reducing the activity of the immune system by attaching to receptors in various types of immune cell.
Each inhalation provides a fixed dose of the medicine.
This means that Airexar Spiromax is similar to a ‘reference medicine' called Seretide Diskus (also known as Seretide Accuhaler), which contains the same active substances.
Therefore, the CHMP's view was that, as for Seretide Diskus, the benefit outweighs the identified risk.
It is not intended to provide practical advice on how to use Airexar Spiromax.
Because Airexar Spiromax is a hybrid medicine and is bioequivalent to the reference medicine, its benefits and risks are taken as being the same as the reference medicine's.
However, Airexar Spiromax is available only as a single high strength, whereas the reference medicine is available in three strengths, the same high strength and two lower strengths.
This is a summary of the European public assessment report (EPAR) for Airexar Spiromax.
The two active substances in Airexar Spiromax are well known and are present in several medicines used to treat asthma and COPD, either alone or in combination with other medicines.
The Committee recommended that Airexar Spiromax be approved for use in the EU.
Airexar Spiromax is a medicine used for the regular treatment of adults with severe asthma and for the relief of symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, a long-term disease in which the airways and air sacs inside the lungs become damaged or blocked, leading to difficulty in breathing).
This leads to a reduction in the release of substances that are involved in the inflammation process, such as histamine, thereby helping to keep the airways clear and allowing the patient to breathe more easily.
The Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Airexar Spiromax has been shown to have comparable quality and to be bioequivalent to Seretide Diskus.
In asthma, Airexar Spiromax can be used in patients whose disease is not adequately controlled despite treatment with a combination of a beta-2 agonist and a lower dose of inhaled corticosteroid, or those whose asthma is already controlled with a long-acting beta-2 agonist and a high-dose of inhaled
When it attaches to these receptors in the airways, it causes the muscles to relax, which keeps the airways open and helps with the patient's breathing.
It works by attaching to receptors known as beta-2 receptors in the muscles of the airways.
In COPD, Airexar Spiromax is used in adults who have had exacerbations (flare-ups) of the disease in the past and have significant symptoms despite regular treatment.
Airexar Spiromax is available as an inhalation powder in a portable inhaler device.
What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of Airexar Spiromax?
It contains the active substances salmeterol (a so-called long-acting beta-2 agonist) and fluticasone
Recommendations and precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients for the safe and effective use of Airexar Spiromax have been included in the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet.
Studies in people have been limited to tests to determine that Airexar Spiromax is bioequivalent to the reference medicine, Seretide Diskus.
Airexar Spiromax can only be obtained with a prescription.
Fluticasone propionate belongs to a group of anti-inflammatory medicines known as corticosteroids.

The main measure of effectiveness was the reduction in diastolic blood pressure (the blood pressure measured between two heartbeats).
Irbesartan is an ‘angiotensin II receptor antagonist', which means that it blocks the action of a hormone in the body called angiotensin II.
By lowering the blood pressure, the risks associated with high blood pressure, such as having a stroke, are reduced.
The combination of the two active substances has an additive effect, reducing the blood pressure more than either medicine alone.
‘Essential' means that the hypertension has no obvious cause.
The most common side effects with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are dizziness, nausea (feeling sick) or vomiting, abnormal urination, fatigue (tiredness), and increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN, a breakdown product of protein), creatinine (a breakdown product of muscle) and creatine kinase (an enzyme found in muscle).
By blocking the receptors to which angiotensin II normally attaches, irbesartan stops the hormone having an effect, allowing the blood vessels to widen.
It is available as oval tablets (peach: 150 mg or 300 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide; pink: 300 mg irbesartan and 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide).
It can be used with hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension.
Increasing the dose to 300 mg irbesartan and 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide may give a further decrease in blood pressure.
The company that makes Karvezide has agreed that its scientific data can be used for Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS.
The studies of Karvea/Aprovel used with hydrochlorothiazide as separate tablets were used to support the use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS.
EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR) IRBESARTAN HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE BMS EPAR summary for the public
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS to Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharma EEIG on 19 January 2007.
Further studies were also carried out with doses of 300 mg irbesartan in combination with 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide.
Angiotensin II is a powerful vasoconstrictor (a substance that narrows blood vessels).
Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to irbesartan, hydrochlorothiazide, sulfonamides, or any of the other ingredients.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS's benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of essential hypertension in adult patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone.
It works by increasing urine output, reducing the amount of fluid in the blood and lowering the blood pressure.
Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS must also not be used in patients who have severe liver, kidney or bile problems, blood potassium levels that are too low or blood calcium levels that are too high.
Irbesartan on its own has been approved in the EU since 1997 under the names Karvea and Aprovel.
Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is used in adults who have essential hypertension (high blood pressure) that is not adequately controlled on irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone.
Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is a medicine that contains two active substances, irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide.
Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS may be added to other treatments for hypertension.
The Committee recommended that Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS be given marketing authorisation.
Doses higher than 300 mg irbesartan and 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once a day are not recommended.
Care must be taken when using Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS with other medicines that have an effect on blood potassium levels.
Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS contains two active substances, irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide.
Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is taken by mouth, with or without food.
The dose of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS to be used depends on the dose of irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide that the patient was taking before.
The full EPAR for Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is available here.
Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic, which is another type of treatment for hypertension.
Why has Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS been approved?
For the full list of all side effects reported with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, see the Package Leaflet.
Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS was more effective than placebo (a dummy treatment) and than hydrochlorothiazide alone in reducing diastolic blood pressure.

Administration of umeclidinium bromide may produce paradoxical bronchospasm that may be lifethreatening.
Umeclidinium bromide has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Following oral administration to healthy male subjects, total radioactivity was excreted primarily in faeces (92% of the administered radiolabelled dose or 99% of the recovered radioactivity) by 168 hours post-dose.
The recommended dose is one inhalation every day at the same time of day.
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.
12-Week Study Treatment difference1 95% Confidence interval p-value
The primary metabolic routes for umeclidinium bromide are oxidative (hydroxylation, O-dealkylation) followed by conjugation (glucuronidation, etc), resulting in a range of metabolites with either reduced pharmacological activity or for which the pharmacological activity has not been established.
If the inhaler cover is opened and closed without inhaling the medicinal product, the dose will be lost.
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Rolufta Ellipta in all subsets of the paediatric population in COPD (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

Umeclidinium bromide is a long acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (also referred to as an anticholinergic).
An overdose of umeclidinium bromide will likely produce signs and symptoms consistent with the known inhaled muscarinic antagonist adverse effects (e.g. dry mouth, visual accommodation disturbances and tachycardia).
24-Week Study Treatment difference1 95% Confidence interval p-value
It demonstrates slow reversibility at the human M3 muscarinic receptor subtype in vitro and a long duration of action in vivo when administered directly to the lungs in pre-clinical models.
In nonclinical studies with umeclidinium bromide, findings were those typically associated with the primary pharmacology of muscarinic receptor antagonists and/or local irritancy.
The patient should be advised to not open the tray until they are ready to inhale a dose.
In vitro studies showed that umeclidinium bromide is principally metabolised by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and is a substrate for the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter.
Although no formal in vivo interaction studies have been performed, inhaled umeclidinium bromide has been used concomitantly with other COPD medicinal products including short and long acting sympathomimetic bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids without clinical evidence of interactions.
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP.
The primary endpoint was annual rate of on-treatment moderate and severe exacerbations in subjects treated with FF/UMC/VI compared with FF/VI.
The absolute bioavailability of inhaled umeclidinium bromide was on average 13% of the dose, with negligible contribution from oral absorption.
Urinary elimination accounted for 22% of the administered radiolabelled dose by 168 hours (27% of recovered radioactivity).
It is not possible to accidentally take extra medicine or a double dose in one inhalation.
The effect of the moderate P-gp inhibitor verapamil (240 mg once daily) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of umeclidinium bromide was assessed in healthy volunteers.
Therefore, umeclidinium bromide should be used with caution in patients with severe cardiovascular disorders, particularly cardiac arrhythmias.
The Ellipta inhaler contains pre-dispensed doses and is ready to use.
Treatment should be discontinued immediately if paradoxical bronchospasm occurs and alternative therapy instituted if necessary.
Umeclidinium bromide plasma elimination half-life following inhaled dosing for 10 days averaged 19 hours, with 3% to 4% active substance excreted unchanged in urine at steady-state.

In a pre- and post-natal study, subcutaneous administration of umeclidinium bromide to rats resulted in lower maternal body weight gain and food consumption and slightly decreased pre-weaning pup body weights in dams given 180 micrograms/kg/day dose (approximately 80-times the human clinical exposure of umeclidinium 55 micrograms, based on AUC).
Following intravenous administration, approximately 58% of the administered radiolabelled dose (or 73% of the recovered radioactivity) was excreted in faeces by 192 hours post-dose.
In the event of deterioration of COPD during treatment with umeclidinium bromide, a re-evaluation of the patient and of the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken.
Rolufta Ellipta contains the active substance umeclidinium bromide, which belongs to a group of medicines called bronchodilators.
The excretion of the drug-related material in the faeces following intravenous dosing indicated secretion into the bile.
This medicine blocks the tightening of these muscles, making it easier for air to get in and out of the lungs.
Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.
Following inhaled administration of umeclidinium bromide in healthy volunteers, Cmax occurred at 5 to 15 minutes.
In a randomised, double-blind, 52-week study (CTT116855, IMPACT) of 10,355 adult patients with symptomatic COPD and a history of 1 or more moderate or severe exacerbations within the prior 12 months, treatment with fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI 99/55/22 micrograms) once daily as a single inhaler was compared with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI 99/22 micrograms) once daily as a single inhaler.
The steady-state pharmacokinetics of umeclidinium bromide were assessed in healthy volunteers lacking CYP2D6 (poor metabolisers).
If you accidentally use too much of this medicine, contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice immediately as you may need medical attention.
What you need to know before you use Rolufta Ellipta 3.
COPD is a long-term condition in which the airways and air-sacs in the lungs gradually become blocked or damaged, leading to breathing difficulties that slowly get worse.
Umeclidinium bromide exerts its bronchodilatory activity by competitively inhibiting the binding of acetylcholine with muscarinic cholinergic receptors on airway smooth muscle.
Rolufta Ellipta is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
The lost dose will be securely held inside the inhaler, but it will no longer be available.
2 years In-use shelf-life after opening the tray: 6 weeks.
The maximum dose is one inhalation of umeclidinium bromide once daily.
Based on the magnitude of these changes, no clinically relevant drug interaction is expected when umeclidinium is co-administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors or when administered to subjects genetically deficient in CYP2D6 activity (poor metabolisers).
When you are ready to use your inhaler, peel back the lid to open the tray.
Once the tray is opened, the inhaler can be used for up to 6 weeks, starting from the date of opening the tray.
The active substance is present as a white powder in a blister inside the inhaler.
A study in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers showed no evidence of a clinically significant effect of CYP2D6 genetic polymorphism on systemic exposure to umeclidinium bromide.
To use Rolufta Ellipta, you breathe it into your lungs through your mouth using the Ellipta inhaler.
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
The mean annual rate of exacerbations was 0.91 and 1.07 for FF/UMEC/VI and FF/VI respectively (Rate Ratio: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.90; p<0.001).
The recommended dose is one inhalation of umeclidinium bromide once daily.
Rolufta Ellipta should not be used to relieve a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing.
• If the dose counter does not count down as you hear the “click”, the inhaler will not deliver medicine.
An approximately 1.3-fold increase in umeclidinium bromide AUC was observed at an 8fold higher dose with no effect on umeclidinium bromide Cmax.
Rolufta Ellipta also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in health-related quality of life measured using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) as indicated by a reduction in SGRQ total score at Week 12 compared with placebo (-7.90 units, p<0.001) in the 12-week study.
Patients receiving Rolufta Ellipta had a higher percentage of days when no rescue medication was needed (on average 31.1%) compared with placebo (on average 21.7%).

28 patches (7 x 2 mg/24h, 7 x 4 mg/24h, 7 x 6 mg/24h, 7 x 8 mg/24h)
The company presented the results of three main studies involving around 900 adults with pain.
The main studies involved relatively young patients and therefore no conclusion could be drawn on how the medicine would work in other age groups.
What was the recommendation of the CHMP at that time?
This means that the CHMP had evaluated the documentation provided by the company and formulated a list of questions.
There was also insufficient information on the safety of the medicine compared with medicines containing only one of the active substances.
The main measures of effectiveness were based on the level of pain relief after two hours, the number of patients who were asleep after one hour and how long the patients slept.
What are the consequences for patients in clinical trials or compassionate use programmes?
The letter from the company notifying the CHMP of the withdrawal of the application is available here.
Its main action is to block receptors for histamine, which is involved in inflammation and allergic reactions, but it also leads to drowsiness which helps to improve sleep.
How far into the evaluation was the application when it was withdrawn?
What documentation did the company present to support its application?
When taken together, the two active substances were expected to provide benefits for patients with pain who have difficulty sleeping because of the pain.
What were the reasons given by the company for withdrawing the application?
Ibuprofen is a painkiller that belongs to the class non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
It works by blocking an enzyme called cyclo-oxygenase, which produces prostaglandins, substances that are involved in the inflammation and pain.
Ibuprofen is found in medicines used to treat pain, inflammation and fever.
Because Ibuprofen/Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride Wyeth was intended to be available without a prescription, the Committee requested more information on how it would interact with other medicines.
The effects of Ibuprofen/Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride Wyeth were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
Ibuprofen/Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride Wyeth contains two active substances that have been available in the European Union for many years in commonly used non-prescription medicines.
After the CHMP had assessed the company's responses to the questions, there were still some unresolved issues.
Based on the review of the data and the company's response to the CHMP list of questions, at the time of the withdrawal, the CHMP had some concerns and was of the provisional opinion that Ibuprofen/Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride Wyeth could not have been approved.
The studies compared the medicine with placebo (a dummy treatment) and a medicine containing ibuprofen alone.
Ibuprofen/Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride Wyeth was expected to be used for the short-term treatment of mild to moderate pain in adults who are having difficulty sleeping because of the pain.
The CHMP noted that the applicant had not shown enough evidence that there was a relevant advantage of using Ibuprofen/Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride Wyeth over using ibuprofen alone.
Ibuprofen/Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride Wyeth is a medicine that contains the active substances ibuprofen and diphenhydramine hydrochloride.
The company informed the CHMP that at present there are no ongoing clinical trials or compassionate use programmes with Ibuprofen/Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride Wyeth.
Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is found in medicines used to treat allergies, cough and sleep problems.
On 7 January 2010, Wyeth Consumer Healthcare officially notified the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that it wishes to withdraw its application for a marketing authorisation for Ibuprofen/Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride Wyeth, for use in the treatment of mild to moderate pain in adults who are having difficulty sleeping because of the pain.

The side effects of Juluca are well known and manageable.
It is not suitable for patients in whom any HIV medicine has stopped working or who are infected with HIV that is resistant to medicines that work in the same way as Juluca's active substances.
Because Juluca does not contain an NRTI, it is free of long-term side effects caused by NRTIs.
Juluca can only be obtained with a prescription and it should be prescribed by doctors experienced in managing HIV infection.
The proportion of patients whose viral load was below 50 copies/ml after 48 weeks was the same for patients switching compared with those remaining on the current medicines (95% in both cases).
The Agency decided that Juluca's benefits are greater than its risks and it can be authorised for use in the EU.
The studies involved a total of 1,028 patients whose HIV infection was well controlled for at least 6 months on a combination of three HIV medicines that included a class of HIV medicines called nucleoside (or nucleotide) reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).
What benefits of Juluca have been shown in studies?
The most serious side effects (which may affect up to 1 in 100) include allergic reactions that include rash or liver damage.
An overview of Juluca and why it is authorised in the EU
Juluca is only used for patients whose levels of HIV-1 in the blood (viral load) have been below 50 copies/ml for at least 6 months on their current HIV treatment combination.
The European Medicines Agency considered that Juluca's effectiveness was comparable to that of combination treatment with three HIV medicines that include NRTIs.
The most common side effects with Juluca are diarrhoea and headache.
Two main studies found that the combination of dolutegravir and rilpivirine (the active substances in Juluca) was effective for keeping HIV infection under control.
For more information about using Juluca, see the package leaflet or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
The two active substances in Juluca, dolutegravir and rilpivirine, block the actions of enzymes that the HIV needs to make copies of itself in the cells it has infected.
• omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole (proton pump inhibitors for reducing stomach acid);
The active substances in Juluca are dolutegravir and rilpivirine.
• dexamethasone given by mouth or by injection (a steroid anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant medicine) except when used as a single-dose treatment;
The studies compared the effectiveness of switching to the combination of dolutegravir and rilpivirine with that of remaining on the current combination of HIV medicines.
Dolutegravir, an integrase inhibitor, blocks an enzyme called integrase while rilpivirine, a non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, blocks the activity of another enzyme called reverse transcriptase.
Juluca is a HIV medicine used to treat adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), a virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
• carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (medicines for epilepsy);
• St John's wort (a herbal medicine used for treating depression).
For the full list of restrictions and side effects of Juluca, see the package leaflet.

The vaccine helps to reduce the symptoms of the diseases.
This is a summary of the European public assessment report.
Information on the prescription status of this product may be found on the label/outer package.
If you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations, read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).
Vaccines work by ‘teaching' the immune system (the body's natural defences) how to defend itself against a disease.
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Purevax RCPCh FeLV on 23 February 2005.
The antibodies will help to protect against the diseases caused by these viruses or bacteria.
The first injection should be given in kittens aged at least eight weeks, with a second injection three to four weeks later.
The canarypox viruses do not spread or multiply in the cat but they do produce proteins from the FeLV genes.
It also helps to reduce viral excretion in case of calicivirus infection for one year after vaccination.
They included young and adult cats of various breeds, but not young kittens.
It can also prevent death due to panleucopenia and prevent FeLV from remaining in the blood.
Its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) on the basis of the documentation provided, led to the recommendations on the conditions of use.
The vaccine is given as two doses injected under the skin.
If the kitten has high levels of antibodies received from the mother in the womb and in the milk, the first vaccination should be delayed until 12 weeks of age.
The cat should be revaccinated for all components one year after the first vaccination course, then every year for chlamydiosis and feline leukaemia, and every three years for rhinotracheitis, calicivirosis and panleucopenia.
The main measure of effectiveness was the level of antibodies in the blood against the viruses and bacteria in the vaccine, with the exception of the FeLV component, whose effectiveness in preventing infection had already been demonstrated in other studies.
Occasionally, cats will develop temporary apathy (loss of interest in surroundings) and anorexia (loss of appetite), as well as hyperthermia (elevated body temperature) lasting for one or two days.
• inactivated (killed) calicivirosis antigens (FCV 431 and G1 strains),
In laboratory conditions, Purevax RCPCh FeLV was demonstrated to provide protection against the diseases listed above.
When exposed to any of these viruses or bacteria later in life, the cat will either not become infected or have a much less serious infection.
When a cat is given the vaccine, the immune system recognises the weakened or killed viruses, the FeLV proteins, and the weakened bacteria as ‘foreign' and makes antibodies against them.
In the field, the studies of Purevax RCPCh FeLV looked at the basic vaccination schedule (2 injections 3-4 weeks apart) and the booster vaccination.
There may be a local reaction at the injection site, with slight pain on touching, itching or oedema (swelling), which disappears within one or two weeks.
• feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) recombinant canarypox virus (vCP97).
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) concluded that the benefits of Purevax RCPCh FeLV exceed the risks for the approved indications and recommended that Purevax RCPCh FeLV be given a marketing authorisation.
The benefit-risk balance may be found in the scientific discussion module of this EPAR.
If self-injection does occur in these people, the doctor should be told that self-injection with a live chlamydial vaccine has occurred.
The vaccine should not be handled by people with a weak immune system.
It was not possible to detect a rise in antibodies against C. felis because of high levels of antibodies in the cats at the beginning of the study.
Purevax RCPCh FeLV is available as a lyophilisate (freeze-dried pellet) and solvent that are made up into a suspension for injection.
In case of accidental self-injection medical advice should be sought immediately and the package leaflet or the label shown to the doctor.
Purevax RCPCh FeLV contains small amounts of weakened or killed viruses and bacteria that cause feline viral rhinotracheitis, calicivirosis, chlamydiosis and panleucopenia.
Purevax RCPCh FeLV is used to vaccinate cats from the age of 8 weeks against:
Purevax RCPCh FeLV should not be used in pregnant cats.
• attenuated feline panleucopenia virus (PLI IV),
In the study looking at booster vaccination, antibody levels against rhinotracheitis herpesvirus, calicivirus infection, feline panleucopenia and C. felis remained stable at a high level or increased slightly.
• attenuated (weakened) feline rhinotracheitis herpesvirus (FHV F2 strain),
• feline panleucopenia (a serious illness causing bloody diarrhoea caused by a parvovirus),
• feline chlamydiosis (a flu-like illness caused by the bacterium C. felis),
• feline leukaemia (an illness affecting the immune system caused by a retrovirus, feline leukaemia virus).
To protect against feline leukaemia, the vaccine contains two genes from the FeLV called env and gag, which have been inserted into another vector (carrier) virus called canarypox using ‘recombinant DNA technology'.
In the field study of basic vaccination there was an increase in antibodies against feline rhinotracheitis herpesvirus, calicivirus infection, and feline panleucopenia viruses.
What benefit has Purevax RCPCh FeLV shown during the studies?
Purevax RCPCh FeLV is a veterinary vaccine that contains:
In the future, the immune system will be able to produce antibodies more quickly when it is again exposed to the viruses or bacteria.
For a full list of the side-effects reported with Purevax RCPCh FeLV, see the package leaflet.
• feline viral rhinotracheitis (a flu-like illness caused by a herpesvirus),
The effectiveness of Purevax RCPCh FeLV has been studied in several trials in laboratory conditions where cats were vaccinated and infected with herpesvirus, calicivirus, C. felis, parvovirus or leukaemia virus.
Feline viral rhinotracheitis, feline chlamydiosis, feline panleucopenia (live attenuated), feline leukaemia and feline calicivirosis (inactivated) vaccine
The contents of the capsules must not be inhaled using any other device.
Side effects seen in studies were generally benign and were considered manageable.
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Xoterna Breezhaler on 19 September 2013.
However, the CHMP considered that its effects on reducing the rate of exacerbations were too small to recommend its use for reducing exacerbations.
It explains how the Agency assessed the medicine to recommend its authorisation in the EU and its conditions of use.
COPD is a long-term disease in which the airways and air sacs inside the lungs become damaged or blocked, leading to difficulty breathing air in and out of the lungs.
The full EPAR for Xoterna Breezhaler can be found on the Agency's website: ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Human medicines/European public assessment reports.
Xoterna Breezhaler has been studied in two main studies involving a total of 2,667 patients with COPD.
The Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Xoterna Breezhaler's benefits are greater than its risks and recommended that it be approved for use in the EU.
The combined action of the two active substances helps to keep the airways open and allows the patient to breathe more easily.
Xoterna Breezhaler is a medicine that contains two active substances, indacaterol (85 micrograms) and glycopyrronium (43 micrograms).
The recommended dose is one inhalation once a day of the powder content of a single capsule.
Glycopyrronium is a muscarinic receptor antagonist.
It works by attaching to beta-2-adrenergic receptors found in the muscles of many organs including the airways of the lungs.
This is a summary of the European public assessment report (EPAR) for Xoterna Breezhaler.
When inhaled, indacaterol reaches the receptors in the airways and activates them.
It is not intended to provide practical advice on how to use Xoterna Breezhaler.
A risk management plan has been developed to ensure that Xoterna Breezhaler is used as safely as possible.
Based on this plan, safety information has been included in the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet for Xoterna Breezhaler, including the appropriate precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients.
The most common side effects with Xoterna Breezhaler (which may affect more than 1 in 10 people) are upper respiratory tract infections (colds).
It is used as maintenance (regular) treatment to relieve symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults.
It is taken at the same time each day using the Xoterno Breezhaler device.
Muscarinic receptor antagonists and long-acting beta-2-adrenergic agonists are commonly combined in the management of COPD.
When glycopyrronium is inhaled, it causes the muscles of the airways to relax.
It works by blocking some receptors called muscarinic receptors, which control the contraction of muscles.
In patients with severely reduced kidney function Xoterna Breezhaler should only be used after a careful benefit-risk assessment.
Xoterna Breezhaler also increased FEV1 by 70 ml more than indacaterol alone and 90 ml than glycopyrronium alone.
Xoterna Breezhaler is available as capsules containing a powder for inhalation can only be obtained with a prescription.
The first study showed that treatment with Xoterna Breezhaler was more effective than placebo and increased FEV1 by an average of 200 ml more.
The effects of Xoterna Breezhaler when used to relieve symptoms of COPD were clinically meaningful.
What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of Xoterna Breezhaler?
While one study compared the effects of Xoterna Breezhaler with those of placebo (a dummy treatment), or indacaterol or glycopyrronium alone, the other study compared Xoterna Breezhaler with fluticasone plus salmeterol, a standard treatment for COPD.
What is Xoterna Breezhaler and what is it used for?
In both studies, the main measure of effectiveness was how Xoterna Breezhaler improved patients' forced expiratory volumes (FEV1, the maximum volume of air a person can breathe out in one second) after 26 weeks of treatment.
The reduction in the rate of exacerbations was 10 to 12% higher with Xoterna Breezhaler than with tiotropium and glycopyrronium.
Regarding its safety, Xoterna Breezhaler is comparable to indacaterol and glycopyrronium used as separate medicines.
For more information about treatment with Xoterna Breezhaler, read the package leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
What benefits of Xoterna Breezhaler have been shown in studies?
A third study studied the effects of Xoterna Breezhaler on the rate of exacerbations (flare-ups) patients experienced during 64 weeks of treatment when compared with treatment with glycopyrronium or tiotropium (other treatments for COPD).
In the second study the average increase in FEV1 was 140 ml more with Xoterna Breezhaler than with treatment with fluticasone and salmeterol.
For practical information about using Xoterna Breezhaler, patients should read the package leaflet or contact their doctor or pharmacist.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Xoterna Breezhaler, see the package leaflet.
The active substances in Xoterna Breezhaler, indacaterol and glycopyrronium, work in different ways to widen the airways and improve breathing in COPD.
Further information on Vyxeos can be found on the Agency's website: ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Human medicines/European public assessment reports.
The doctor may delay doses or stop treatment if the patient has severe side effects.
They interfere in different ways with the production of new DNA within cells, which means the cells are unable to grow and multiply, and they eventually die.
The side effects were similar to the known side effects of the active substances and were considered manageable.
Side effects reported with Vyxeos are carefully evaluated and any necessary action taken to protect patients.
The European Medicines Agency decided that Vyxeos's benefits are greater than its risks and it can be authorised for use in the EU.
Recommendations and precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients for the safe and effective use of Vyxeos have been included in the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet.
The liposomes protect the cancer medicines from being broken down early, which is expected to enhance their effect on cancer cells.
The most common side effects with Vyxeos (which may affect more than 1 in 5 people) are hypersensitivity (allergic reactions, especially rash), febrile neutropenia (low white cell counts with fever), oedema (swelling), diarrhoea, colitis (inflamed bowel), mucositis (inflammation of the moist body surfaces), tiredness, muscle and bone pain, belly pain, decreased appetite, cough, headache, chills, arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythm), fever, sleep disorders and hypotension (low blood pressure).
As for all medicines, data on the use of Vyxeos are continuously monitored.
Some 34% of patients given Vyxeos (52 of 153) were able to go on to have a stem cell transplant (a potentially curative procedure where the patient's bone marrow is replaced by stem cells to form new, healthy bone marrow) compared with 25% (39 of 156) given conventional treatment.
Vyxeos can only be obtained with a prescription and treatment should be started and supervised by a doctor experienced in using cancer medicines.
What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of Vyxeos?
The liposomes are expected to remain in the patient's body for longer than conventional cytarabine and daunorubicin medicines and to build up in the patient's bone marrow.
An overview of Vyxeos and why it is authorised in the EU
What benefits of Vyxeos have been shown in studies?
The active substances in Vyxeos, cytarabine and daunorubicin, have been used together to treat leukaemia and other types of cancer for many years.
Patients given Vyxeos lived on average around 9.6 months after treatment, whereas those given conventional cytarabine and daunorubicin lived about 6 months.
For more information about using Vyxeos, see the package leaflet or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
Vyxeos is used when the leukaemia was caused by previous treatments (e.g. for other cancers) or is associated with certain changes in the bone marrow known as myelodysplasia.
Vyxeos improved survival compared with conventional cytarabine and daunorubicin in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia who have a poor prognosis and few alternatives.
The study compared Vyxeos with conventional cytarabine and daunorubicin infusions.
Vyxeos has been shown to improve how long patients lived in one main study involving 309 patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukaemia linked to previous treatment or associated with myelodysplasia.
Vyxeos is a cancer medicine used to treat adults with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia, a cancer of white blood cells.
For the full list of side effects and restrictions with Vyxeos, see the package leaflet.
In this medicine, cytarabine and daunorubicin are contained in tiny fat droplets called ‘liposomes'.
The dose is calculated based on the patient's height and weight; the infusion is given over 90 minutes on days 1, 3 and 5 of an initial treatment course; if the disease responds and the doctor considers further courses would be of benefit, Vyxeos is given on days 1 and 3 of each further course.
The active substances in Vyxeos are daunorubicin and cytarabine.
